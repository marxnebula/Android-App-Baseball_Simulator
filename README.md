Android Application: Educational Baseball Simulator

Currently on google play called MATH SLUGGER.

Have you ever wondered the physics behind successfully hitting a home run? Based on input variables by the user, 
Math slugger graphically displays the trajectory of a baseball off the bat and determines if it was a home run. 
You can select between any ballpark, cycle through which part of the field you are trying to hit a home run, 
turn on/off air resistance, and even select between different celestial objects other than Earth!

- Developed Android application using Android Studio to exhibit the graphed trajectory of a baseball off the bat
- User can input specific variables including launch angle, speed of the ball off the bat, and gravity
- All mathematics derived from scratch
- Includes all baseball stadiums with correct outfield dimensions
- Created all art and music in Paint.Net and FamiTracker
